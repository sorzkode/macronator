## macronator

A VBA script that:
```
  1. Opens multiple workbooks.
  2. Runs a different macro in each workbook.
  3. Saves each workbook with a new name, and to a new directory.
  4. Closes each workbook.
  5. Prompts the user when finished
 ```
 *you will need to edit the code to make it work for yourself. VBA isn't my strong suite and I'm sure there's a more elegent way to accomplish this using loops. However, it gets the job done. 


## setup

Make the following chnges to the code:
```
  1. Update the filepaths to point to your workbooks.
  2. Update the save as names to whatever you want.
  3. Update the save locations to a directory of your choosing.
  4. Update the name of the macros that you will run in each workbook.
```  
The script is setup for 5 workbooks but I've tested it with 10 different workbooks with no issues.
