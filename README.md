# macronator
VBA code that will open multiple workbooks, run the built in macro in each workbook, save them with a new name, to a new location, close the workbooks, and pop-up a messagebox when finished. 


You will need to edit the code to include the filepaths to your workbooks, their new save names, and save locations. The script is setup for 5 workbooks but I've tested it with 10 different workbooks with no issues. The code isn't the most efficient way to accomplish this task I'm sure but I was unable to find alternative solutions when I was searching online.
